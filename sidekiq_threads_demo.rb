puts "What we just did:"
puts "  1. Created 5 worker threads with Thread.new (like Sidekiq)"
puts "  2. Each thread ran a loop waiting for jobs"
puts "  3. When jobs arrived, threads picked them up and ran them"
puts "  4. Multiple jobs ran CONCURRENTLY on different threads"
puts
puts "This is EXACTLY how Sidekiq works:"
puts "  - Sidekiq creates threads with Thread.new"
puts "  - Each thread is a Ruby thread (same as Thread.new)"
puts "  - Your job code runs inside those threads"
puts "  - Multiple jobs can run at the same time"
